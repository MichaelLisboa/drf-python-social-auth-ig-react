# A one-click Instagram authentication system, using Django Rest Framework, Python Social Auth, and React JS
### The hardest part of this was getting Instagram API approval.

#### The rest of this will come as I make it...

#### Side note: While django-rest-framework-social-oauth2 is a great package, it has the worst documentation ever, so I'll write an article about my journey and how to set up React/DRF/python-social-auth soon. Hopefully that'll save you some time figuring stuff out.
